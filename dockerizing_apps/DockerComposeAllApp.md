# Running all the apps using docker-compose

Here we will start all the app dockerized so far using docker-compose.

## Setup your environment

I'm assuming you already have Docker installed or using [Play With Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/)

If you haven't already cloned this repository then please do so

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/youben11/docker-workshops
```

You will then want to go to the folder of this workshop

```bash
$ cd docker-workshops/dockerizing_apps
```
